# Plugins
Basic plugins for Reposilite, maintained with core project.

* [example-plugin](./example-plugin) - Basic template of Reposilite plugin in Java with Gradle KTS configuration (preferred over Groovy script file).
* [groovy-plugin](./groovy-plugin) - Utility plugin that enables scripting API in Groovy. In general, you should probably use Java/Kotlin for better experience and performance, but that's still an option - especially useful for quick prototyping of dirty scripts.

If you're interested in extending Reposilite with a new plugin, you should probably create a new repository.
Let us know about your work, so we can list your project below!
