## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've spotted security vulnerability or something that could be treated as a security issue, visit [Security Advisory](https://github.com/dzikoysk/reposilite/security) and use `Report a vulnerability` form.
As soon as possible, I'll investigate this case with the highest possible priority. 
Because it's free and open source project, there is no guarantee how fast the fix may happen.
