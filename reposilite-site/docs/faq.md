**Q:** Maven randomly interrupts deploy and throws socket write error <br>
**A:** It is a common issue on Java 12 due to the bug related to SSL. To resolve this problem, just change Java version used by Maven build, e.g. 8 or 14. 

**Q:** Checksum validation failed on the maven-metadata.xml <br>
**A:** Checksum validation always fails, because Reposilite does not trust the metadata files offered by client - they're generated by server, based on the repository content to ensure consistency. 
It's fine and it does not affect your builds.

**Q:** Repository content is not updated when I use CDN *(like Cloudflare)*<br>
**A:** It is a problem with CDN cache, because Reposilite does not store any files in memory to reduce usage of resources. 
You should take a look at cache policy of your provider. 
For instance, if you use Cloudflare, you can set `Cache Level` to `Bypass` through the custom page rules.
