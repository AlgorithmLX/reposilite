Reposilite supports S3-compatible storages as a backend for Maven repository.

Known S3-compatible storages used by our community:

| Name                                            | Description                           | Compatibility |
|:------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------|:--------------|
| [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)            | Amazon Simple Storage Service         | ✔️            |
| [MinIO](https://min.io/)                        | Popular self-hosted object storage    | ✔️            |
| [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/r2/) | Cloudflare's distributed edge storage | ✔️*           |
| [Ceph](https://ceph.io/)                        | Used by cloud provides like Contabo   | ✔️**          |

\* - Small user base, so it may has some quirks <br/>
\** - There were some issues with Ceph in the past, but it looks good enough lately

Each repository has individual storage provider configuration, 
so some of them can use object storage and others can use local filesystem.
There's important implication of this:

`Note` - **Each S3 configuration has to use dedicated bucket.**

S3 configuration can be defined in the `Dashboard -> Settings -> Maven -> <Repository>` section:

![S3 Configuration](/images/guides/s3-config.png)

These values depend on your S3 provider & its configuration, 
so you have to check their documentation to find out how to configure them.

### MinIO

MinIO is a popular self-hosted object storage compatible with S3 API.
A lot of Reposilite users are using this solution, so here are some tips:

Reposilite uses official AWS SDK that uses the latest version of S3 API.
Unfortunately, MinIO supports only path-style access, 
so you have to add a special JVM flag (`JAVA_OPTS` env variable for Docker users) to enable it:

```bash
-Dreposilite.s3.pathStyleAccessEnabled=true
```

Properties:

```yaml
bucket: your-bucket
endpoint: http://minio:9000 # your minio endpoint
access-key: your-access-key
secret-key: your-secret-key
region: doesn't matter, e.g. us-east-1
```

### Cloudflare R2

R2 has limited permission system,
so you may want to disable automated bucket creation in Reposilite to grant more adequate permissions.
It can be done by another system property:

```bash
-Dreposilite.s3.skip-bucket-creation=true
```

### Ceph

Ceph is not fully compatible with S3 API. Known issues:
* Object listing is not supported - Reposilite won't be able to e.g. list all versions of the artifact or display directory content in the UI
